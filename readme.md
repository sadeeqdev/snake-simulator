# Snake Game in C using NCurses

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the NCurses library in C. The game runs in the terminal and features a snake that moves around the screen, eats food, and grows in length while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have the NCurses library installed on your system. You can install it on a Unix-based system (e.g., Linux or macOS) using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev   # On Debian/Ubuntu
```
